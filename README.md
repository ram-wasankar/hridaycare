- **Interactive Web Interface:** Provides an intuitive web interface for users to input their data and receive predictions and recommendations instantly.
- **Email Report Generation:** Allows users to generate and send a detailed medical report to their healthcare provider for further evaluation.
- **AI chatbot intgration:** Talk to your personal healthcare assistant hridaya for any queries.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python:** Utilized for backend development, including data processing, model training, and web server implementation.
- **Flask:** Chosen as the web framework for its simplicity, flexibility, and scalability in building web applications.
- **Pandas and NumPy:** Employed for data manipulation and preprocessing tasks.
- **Scikit-learn:** Used for building and training the Random Forest Classifier model for heart disease prediction.
- **HTML and CSS:** Implemented the frontend interface for user interaction and styling.
- **JavaScript:** Included for client-side scripting and interaction with the Botpress chatbot integration.
